                    Chandler Muriel Bing is one of the main characters on the popular sitcom Friends. He is portrayed by Matthew Perry. He is notable for his sarcastic and witty sense of humor.  Chandler can always be counted on for a zinger or quip. As he put it, <b>“I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable… I say more dumb things before 9 a.m. than most people say all day.”</b> Things are always a little more entertaining when Chandler is around, although sometimes his spicy one-liners can be insensitive or annoying to his friends. He means well, though. Probably. His relationships tend to skew towards the <b>“Is he really going out with her?”</b> type. (Exhibit A: the screeching Janice.) However, once in a solid relationship, Chandler has demonstrated that not only can he be invested, but be capable of devotion and vulnerability. Too often, though, he lets his own insecurities and unease get in the way. As he even admits, <b>“I’m hopeless and awkward and desperate for love!”</b>
